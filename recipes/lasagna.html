        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lasagne (US: /ləˈzɑːnjə/, also UK: /ləˈzænjə/,[1] Italian: [laˈzaɲɲe]; singular lasagna, Italian: [laˈzaɲɲa]) are a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types,[2] made of very wide, flat sheets.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 lb. lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>1 tsp. extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
            <li>2 lb. ground beef</li>
            <li>14 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 tsp. dried oregano</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 (32-0z.) jars marinara</li>
            <li>16 oz. whole milk ricotta</li>
            <li>1/2 c. freshly grated Parmesan, divided</li>
            <li>1/4 c. chopped parsley, plus more for garnish</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>2 lb. sliced mozzarella</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375º. In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta according to package directions until al dente, less 2 minutes. Drain and drizzle a bit of olive oil to prevent noodles from sticking together.
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a large pot over medium-high heat, heat oil. Cook ground beef until no longer pink, breaking up with a wooden spoon. Remove from heat and drain fat. Return beef to skillet and add garlic and oregano and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper, then add marinara and stir until warmed through. 
            </li>
            <li>Combine ricotta, 1/4 cup Parmesan, parsley, and egg in a large mixing bowl and season with salt and pepper. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>In a large casserole dish, evenly spread a quarter of the meat sauce across the bottom of the dish, then top with a single layer of lasagna noodles, a layer of ricotta mixture, a single layer of mozzarella, and a layer of meat sauce. Repeat layers, topping the last layer of noodles with meat sauce, Parmesan, and mozzarella.
            </li>
            <li>Cover with foil and bake for 15 minutes, then increase temperature to 400º and bake uncovered for 18 to 20 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Garnish with parsley before serving. 
            </li>
        </ol>
